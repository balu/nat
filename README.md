Natural numbers in Python and Ocaml: A comparison of languages

Implements unbounded natural numbers in both Python and Ocaml with logarithmic storage and linear-time addition.

Homework

  1. Loop invariant proof to prove that `add()` is correct in python.
  2. Implement `add1` in Ocaml to enforce the recurrence t(n) â‰¤ t(n/2) + O(1).
